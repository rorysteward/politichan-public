##First ever project coded

It supposed to be an imageboard such as 4chan and others, my vision is to build it around gov.uk css but I see some limitations there (I am currently learning all this)

## Objectives -

- learn coding

Requirements:
PHP 7, MySQL 8, Minio/Amazon S3(working) or B2(currently disabled) to store images, Recaptcha, and composer to install some dependencies

##Build with Codeigniter 4 and GOV.UK Frontend.
